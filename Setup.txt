- Dexscreener can't be accessed by bots due to cloudflare, so instead we'll initiate the browser with port 9222 then connect our webapp.

start chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\chrome-profile" //for chrome
start msedge --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\edge-playwright-profile" // for edge
